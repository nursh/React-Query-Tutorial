- usequery takes two arguments
  - query key is used to keep track of queries in the cache(in an array)
    - when things change it performs a new fetch
    - used to identify the current query
  - the query function -> what fetches the data
  - See App.tsx in react-query-tutorial

  - option 1: use isSuccess and then show data
  - option 2: use isLoading and then show loading state
  - combine both(most resilient)
